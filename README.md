Game Overview
Working Title: Eidos
Based on: The Island of Four Ps
Genre: Open-zone Action RPG
Perspective: Third-person
Platform: PC (controller supported)
Target Audience: ages 16 - 25 
Core Fantasy:
The player explores a world where ideas are alive; debating, battling, studying, and reshaping them to discover what they truly believe in and want to become.

High Concept
In a world where ideas take physical form, the player journeys through the Island of the Four Ps, battling and studying living concepts called Eidos. By engaging with passions, principles, partners, plans and their darker counterparts, the player learns how ideas evolve and how unchecked ideas can become dangerous. Progression is driven not just by combat, but by understanding. 
Story and Narrative
World Premise
In this world, ideas do not simply exist in the mind. They form, grow, and culminate into beings known as Eidos, manifestations of perfect ideas from another realm. Every belief, desire, or habit has the potential to become an Eidos.
The Island of the Four Ps is divided into major regions, each representing a fundamental category of ideas. These regions are not just locations, but philosophies made physical.
Narrative Structure
Semi-linear progression through major regions
Open exploration within villages (zones)
Story advances after completing each major “P” area
Dialogue, environmental storytelling, and battles communicate theme

Characters
Guide Character
Archimedes
Archimedes serves as the player’s guide and mentor. He introduces the rules of the world, explains the nature of Eidos, and functions as the tutorial anchor for each new system.
Play Character
Base character is androgynous 
Begins with a base Eidos: Adventurer
Neutral, adaptable idea type
Evolves based on the Eidos the player studies, captures, and combines
Represents curiosity, growth, and self-discovery
Eidos (Idea Beings)
Physical manifestations of ideas
Each Eidos represents a specific concept (e.g., Passion, Discipline, Addiction)
Can morph or upgrade into new forms
Example: One passion can evolve into another passion
Or become distorted if overused or unbalanced
Hostile Eidos
Found in darker neighborhoods
Represent unfavorable or destructive ideas:
Smoking
Gambling
Obsession
More aggressive behavior and corrupted visual design
Chance to accidentally capture them if battled with too much 
Area Bosses
Each major “P” region culminates in a concept boss
Example:
Village of Passions → Boss: Passion itself
Boss battles require the player to sufficiently understand the ideas in that region
GamePlay
Core Gameplay Loop
Explore an open village zone
Encounter Eidos in neighborhoods
Battle or debate ideas in real time
Study Eidos through repeated encounters
Capture Eidos using the appropriate “idea type”
Modify, combine, or deconstruct Eidos
Fill the Tessamark
Confront the region’s core concept boss
Advance the story

Combat & Debate System
Real-time battles mixed with turn-based abilities 
Combat is framed as debate rather than pure violence
The more times an Eidos is battled:
The higher the chance to study it
Studying unlocks deeper understanding and capture ability
Studying & Capturing
To capture an Eidos:
The player must understand it
The player must possess the correct idea type needed to contain it 
Encourages repeated engagement, not brute force

Tessamark System
The Tessamark is a core progression mechanic
Allows the player to:
Compare Eidos
Combine different Eidos types
Required to unlock boss encounters
Tessamark must be filled to a certain threshold through debates 




Levels & Environments
Villages (Open Zones)
Each village represents a category of ideas 
Open exploration encouraged
Neighborhoods vary in tone:
Safe, curious, lively areas
Dark, hostile, distorted areas

Village of Passions
First major open zone
Introduced after guided entry with Archimedes
Player is “let loose” after tutorial
Wide variety of Passion-based Eidos
Ends with confrontation against Passion as a concept

Progression Flow
Village of Passions 
Story interlude with Archimedes
Journey to Village of Principles 
Additional Regions follow the structure of the Four Ps




Art Direction
Eidos
Semi-abstract, symbolic character designs
Eidos visually communicate their idea
Hostile Eidos appear warped or unstable
Villages feel alive, crowded with concepts
Dark neighborhoods feel tense

Audio
Music shifts based on idea density
Calm, curious tones in open villages
Distorted, uneasy soundscapes in hostile neighborhoods
Boss encounters emphasize conceptual weight, not aggression

Assets
Low-poly assets with high-poly baked on
High resolution textures
Base character model to be easily reused
