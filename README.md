## **Story and Narrative** {#story-and-narrative}

**World Premise**  
In this world, ideas do not simply exist in the mind. They form, grow, and culminate into beings known as Eidos, manifestations of perfect ideas from another realm. Every belief, desire, or habit has the potential to become an Eidos.

The Island of the Four Ps is divided into major regions, each representing a fundamental category of ideas. These regions are not just locations, but philosophies made physical.

**Narrative Structure**

* Semi-linear progression through major regions  
* Open exploration within villages (zones)  
* Story advances after completing each major “P” area  
* Dialogue, environmental storytelling, and battles communicate theme

## **Characters** {#characters}

**Guide Character**

*Archimedes*  
Archimedes serves as the player’s guide and mentor. He introduces the rules of the world, explains the nature of Eidos, and functions as the tutorial anchor for each new system.

**Play Character**

* Base character is androgynous   
* Begins with a base Eidos: Adventurer  
* Neutral, adaptable idea type  
* Evolves based on the Eidos the player studies, captures, and combines  
* Represents curiosity, growth, and self-discovery

**Eidos (Idea Beings)**

* Physical manifestations of ideas  
* Each Eidos represents a specific concept (e.g., Passion, Discipline, Addiction)  
* Can morph or upgrade into new forms  
  * Example: One passion can evolve into another passion  
  * Or become distorted if overused or unbalanced

**Hostile Eidos**

* Found in darker neighborhoods  
* Represent unfavorable or destructive ideas:  
  * Smoking  
  * Gambling  
  * Obsession  
* More aggressive behavior and corrupted visual design  
* Chance to accidentally capture them if battled with too much 

**Area Bosses**

* Each major “P” region culminates in a concept boss  
* Example:  
  * Village of Passions → Boss: Passion itself  
* Boss battles require the player to sufficiently understand the ideas in that region

## **GamePlay** {#gameplay}

**Core Gameplay Loop**

1. Explore an open village zone  
2. Encounter Eidos in neighborhoods  
3. Battle or debate ideas in real time  
4. Study Eidos through repeated encounters  
5. Capture Eidos using the appropriate “idea type”  
6. Modify, combine, or deconstruct Eidos  
7. Fill the Tessamark  
8. Confront the region’s core concept boss  
9. Advance the story

**Combat & Debate System**

* Real-time battles mixed with turn-based abilities   
* Combat is framed as debate rather than pure violence  
* The more times an Eidos is battled:  
  * The higher the chance to study it  
  * Studying unlocks deeper understanding and capture ability

**Studying & Capturing**

* To capture an Eidos:  
  * The player must understand it  
  * The player must possess the correct idea type needed to contain it   
* Encourages repeated engagement, not brute force

**Tessamark System**  
The Tessamark is a core progression mechanic

* Allows the player to:  
  * Compare Eidos  
  * Combine different Eidos types  
* Required to unlock boss encounters  
  * Tessamark must be filled to a certain threshold through debates 

## **Levels & Environments** {#levels-&-environments}

**Villages (Open Zones)**

* Each village represents a category of ideas   
* Open exploration encouraged  
* Neighborhoods vary in tone:  
  * Safe, curious, lively areas  
  * Dark, hostile, distorted areas

**Village of Passions**

* First major open zone  
* Introduced after guided entry with Archimedes  
* Player is “let loose” after tutorial  
* Wide variety of Passion-based Eidos  
* Ends with confrontation against Passion as a concept

**Progression Flow**

* Village of Passions   
* Story interlude with Archimedes  
* Journey to Village of Principles   
* Additional Regions follow the structure of the Four Ps

## **Art Direction** {#art-direction}

**Eidos**

* Semi-abstract, symbolic character designs  
* Eidos visually communicate their idea  
* Hostile Eidos appear warped or unstable  
* Villages feel alive, crowded with concepts  
* Dark neighborhoods feel tense

**Audio**

* Music shifts based on idea density  
* Calm, curious tones in open villages  
* Distorted, uneasy soundscapes in hostile neighborhoods  
* Boss encounters emphasize conceptual weight, not aggression

**Assets**

* Low-poly assets with high-poly baked on  
* High resolution textures  
* Base character model to be easily reused
